## **About Section**
I am a final-year Computer Science student passionate about turning complex problems into clean, efficient code. My journey in tech is defined by a hands-on approach—whether it’s building **TermsDecoder**, an AI tool that helps people understand legal jargon and detect deepfakes, or developing **OmniCalc Pro**, a fully responsive financial dashboard.

I specialize in **Full Stack Development** and **Python Automation**, with a strong command of **React.js, Node.js, and SQL**. Beyond development, I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges (200+ problems on LeetCode) and simulating financial markets using code.

I am currently looking for an entry-level Software Engineer role where I can apply my skills in building scalable applications and contribute to innovative engineering teams.

**Technical Toolkit:**
